      #### The Client


      Meyerview is an equestrian consultant specializing in various aspects of the equine world, ensuring optimal stabling, flooring, watering, and ancillary services. With extensive expertise in arena and track renovations, they excel in installing both natural and synthetic surfaces, taking care of all drainage and sub-base requirements.


      #### The Challenge


      Natalie expressed a strong desire to incorporate horses into the brandmark, and I collaborated closely with her to find an effective way to achieve this. The primary goal was to create a visual element that would instantly resonate with her clients and effectively convey her exceptional expertise offered worldwide.


      #### The Solution


      With Meyerview's identity, I successfully integrated the equestrian essence of the business into the logo. By utilizing a shield-style frame, I achieved both visual balance and a strong anchor that could be extended throughout the branding. The result is an unmistakable representation of Meyerview that captures the essence of Natalie's expertise and establishes a strong connection with her audience.
