      ### The Client


      Whether you seek a tranquil haven to lose yourself in a book, recline in a wildflower meadow while watching drifting clouds, or explore the enchanting woodland while listening to the symphony of birdsong, Ritty Retreats beckons. Our thoughtfully designed cabins are your doorway to nature, inviting you to reconnect with yourself and your companions.


      ### The Challenge


      The task was to effectively capture and convey the inherent natural essence that defines Ritty's cabins and the surrounding landscapes. Infusing the design with an earthy and organic ambiance was paramount. Equally crucial was the integration of their freshly captured photography, portraying their idyllic locale nestled within the embrace of the Black Mountains.


      ### The Solution


      Adhering to the brand's distinct color palette and leveraging the newly acquired photography, I crafted a series of designs that seamlessly meld together, seamlessly guiding users toward three of Ritty's unique cabins and insights into local attractions. I established a clear hierarchy within the design, ensuring a smooth and unhindered user journey. The end result is an unobtrusive and fluid interface that reflects the serene ethos of Ritty Retreats.
