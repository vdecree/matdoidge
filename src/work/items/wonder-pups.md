       #### The Client

      Growing up in Sweden, Hanna Ascough always had a love of animals. Dogs, cats, horses and bunnies all played a huge part in her life. Hanna is committed to providing the highest level of service for furry and non-furry clients, which means she is always engaging with the most current research and methodology.


      #### The Challenge


      Working alongside Ryan from Gittings Studio, we set out with a clear vision for Wonder Pups. We needed it be stand out from the competition and get across Hannahs personality and passion. We knew this couldn't be just any ordinary dog training website.


      #### The Solution


      We opted for a bold colour palette which helps give the site a playful and fun feel. By splitting the pages into blocks and focussing on delivery of the most important information we give potential clients a clear and easy path through the site.
