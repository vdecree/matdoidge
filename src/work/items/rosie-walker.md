       ### The Client

      Rosie Walker is a Fitness, Nutrition & Lifestyle Coach based in Gloucestershire, UK. She helps her clients to reach their health and wellness goals. With over 5 years of experience in the field, Rosie has a proven track record of empowering clients to make lasting changes in their lives.


      ### The Challenge


      Rosie needed a site easy to maintain and evolve over time with her new venture. The most important thing was to provide a means for Rosie to write content to a blog covering any of her three core services. It needed to be fast, efficient and easy-to-use.


      ### The Solution


      Leveraging the power of 11ty and Netlify CMS, I built Rosie a bespoke website with everything she needs to manage her content and provide the user with a great experience.
