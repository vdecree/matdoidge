       #### The Client

      MCG Electrical Contractors are a fully accredited, experienced electrical contractors and maintenance organisation based in Gloucestershire and now working at a local and national level across a variety of sectors, including commercial, residential, care, hospitality and manufacturing.


      #### The Challenge


      MCG Electrical had an outdated and basic website that provided little benefit to the company. It was crucial to showcase the high-end nature of their work through the design and effectively convey the breadth of their abilities within the electrical contracting sector.


      #### The Solution


      To elevate MCG Electrical above the competition, I implemented a high-end finish to the website. I utilized a strong yet neutral color scheme and structured the content in an easy-to-digest manner, allowing users to navigate through the company's extensive offerings quickly and effortlessly. Additionally, I completely redesigned the brandmark to convey a strong and technical appearance while ensuring responsiveness across various sizes and mediums.
