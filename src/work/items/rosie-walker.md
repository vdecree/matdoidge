       #### A full re-design for Immediate Theatres aging website.

      Immediate Theatre have been working with young people and communities in Hackney and East London for 25 years. On behalf of Gittings Studio I was tasked with redesigning their website and trying to bring some order to the plethora of content types used throughout the site while keeping it on brand.
