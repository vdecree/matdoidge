       #### The Client

      C H Barons Ltd is an established carpentry-based construction company located in the picturesque South Hams region. With over 19 years of experience, they have built a solid reputation for delivering top-notch craftsmanship, where their unwavering attention to detail takes precedence.


      #### The Challenge


      With no existing online presence or branding, it was crucial to portray C H Barons as a firmly established and experienced carpentry company. The website needed to be fast, efficient, and, above all, easy to update and maintain for the team. Additionally, I aimed to ensure that the branding seamlessly translated across all mediums, effectively representing the exceptional quality finish that C H Barons provides.


      #### The Solution


      In collaboration with C H Barons, I created a monogram-style brand mark that is responsive and adaptable across various sizes and mediums, including branded clothing. The website was developed using the Kirby CMS, providing the team with a remarkably fast, efficient, and user-friendly platform for future website maintenance. Most importantly, it successfully conveys the company's commitment to delivering quality craftsmanship.
