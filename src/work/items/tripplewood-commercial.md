      #### The Client


      Tripplewood Commercial shopfitting are driven by their passion for turning design concepts into stunning realities. With meticulous attention to detail, they transform each project into a masterpiece, bringing their clients dreams and visions to life with unparalleled craftsmanship and quality.


      #### The Challenge


      The team at Tripplewood aimed for a professional and versatile logo that could be applied to various mediums, including clothing and vehicles. It was essential to create a mature and experienced impression through the design.


      #### The Solution


      I developed a distinct logo symbol that can be used independently from the logo-type, providing Tripplewood with the desired flexibility. This logo now represents the company's commitment to quality shopfitting services, allowing customers to easily identify and associate with their brand.
